My name is David Ross and I am a master’s student in bioinformatics and computational biomedicine at Oregon Health & Science University, graduating June 2021. I am also currently a Biostatistics Intern at NanoString Technologies, Inc. Prior to pursuing a master’s, I developed software, from accounting systems to iPhone apps.
