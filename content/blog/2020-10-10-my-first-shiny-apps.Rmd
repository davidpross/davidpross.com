This summer I worked at the [Earle A. Chiles Research Institute](https://oregon.providence.org/our-services/e/earle-a-chiles-research-institute/) doing bioinformatics analyses for a cancer immunology researcher. To allow the researcher, without my presence or his knowing [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), to perform similar analyses in the future, I created a couple of  [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps. These apps are a web interface to interactively explore data. I have demos [here](https://daveross.shinyapps.io/ihc-viewer/) and [here](https://daveross.shinyapps.io/tcrr/), and more background information below.

## [IHC viewer](https://daveross.shinyapps.io/ihc-viewer/)

Immunohistochemistry of tumor samples can show the spatial arrangement of different classes of cells in the tumor immune microenvironment. Using software from [Akoya Biosciences](https://www.akoyabio.com/phenoptics/software/inform-tissue-finder/), a scientist in the lab processed these images and assigned coordinates and phenotypes to several thousand cells in multiple regions of interest. I created an interface to view the arrangement of cells and calculate various statistics, primarily with the R package [`spatstat`](http://spatstat.org/).

## [TCRR](https://daveross.shinyapps.io/tcrr/)

Using data from an assay developed by [Adaptive Biotechnologies](https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/products-services/immunoseq/), this app draws a [circos](http://circos.ca/) plot showing shared sequences in different cell populations.

## Future development

Both of these apps were created specifically for the analyses at hand, for the lab I worked in this summer. I hope to continue development of the apps in the future and share the results with the open source bioinformatics community.
