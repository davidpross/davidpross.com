<p>This plot was created for my data visualization class to explore the benefits of a bar graph. I find the bar graph sorted by the other variable a very effective pattern. The data for the plot was downloaded in April from the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">CDC</a>.</p>

dt &lt;- dt[state %in% state.name &amp; !is.na(perc_vaccinated)]
# order by vaccination status
dt[, state := factor(state, levels = dt[order(perc_vaccinated), state])]
