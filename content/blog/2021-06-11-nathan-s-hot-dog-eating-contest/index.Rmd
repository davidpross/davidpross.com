One of the first labs for our data visualization class was to progressively improve a plot displaying the results of many years of a hot dog eating contest. It was enjoyable to take the time to understand the story you are telling and improve the plot through custom annotations.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
# read in and filter dataset with affiliation
dt_all <- fread("hot_dog_contest_with_affiliation.csv",
            colClasses = c(gender = "factor", affiliated = "factor"))
dt_all[, post_ifoce := year >= 1997]
dt <- dt_all[year >= 1981 & gender == 'male']
```

```{r}
breaks <- seq(1981, 2017)
labels <- ifelse(breaks %in% seq(1981, 2017, 4), breaks, "")
text_labels <- dt[, .(x = mean(year), y = 5, min = min(year), max = max(year)), by = affiliated]
text_labels[, height := c(4, 8, 4)]
levels(text_labels$affiliated) <- c("MLE/IFOCE Current Member",
                                    "MLE/IFOCE\nFormer Member",
                                    "No MLE/IFOCE Affiliation")

dt %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = num_eaten, fill = affiliated)) +
